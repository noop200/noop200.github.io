    <p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed trough some interesting places on the way: Walla Walla, WA, Magic City, ID, Bountiful, UT, Last Chance, CO, Why, AZ and Truth or Consequence, NM</p>
    <h3>July 14, 2012</h3>
    <p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today: "Passing cars, When you can´t see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity." I defenitely won´t be passing any cars</p>

  <p>My first day of the trip! I can´t believe finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I´m on a Segway, I wasn´t able to bring a whole lot with me: cell phone, iPod, digital Camera and protein bar. Just the essential. As Loa Tzu would have said, "A yourney of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."</p>
